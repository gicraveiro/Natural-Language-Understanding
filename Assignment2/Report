Assignment 2 Report

Coming soon!

On that note,
a simple evaluation was successfully implemented for the first part, total and per token
However, the conlleval evaluation still outputs a strange error, despite its parameters (references and hypothesis), who seem fine
Strange error source identified!!! The parameters are not built correctly... they were supposed to be in the format of a list of lists, the outer list has many sentences, the inner list has all tokens of the sentence with the 2 parameters needed
Strange error was successfully eliminated!! Now the conlleval evaluation is functional!!
Simple evaluation upgraded to using scikit learn classification report method, also functional!

The entity grouping was also majorly implemented but the entities that don't belong to noun chunks are not present yet
There is also still an issue with the frequency analysis part, my guess is that I spent so many neurons this afternoon that they can no longer help me finish this relatively simple frequency count in time

I apologize in advance, but let's hope everything gets implemented soon!

Prevision of conclusion: approximately 3 days

It really has been a pleasure to code nlp-related assignments and I do hope it's understandable that my mental health is just as important as my career, as well as my internship and other classes are just as important as this one

In any case, Thank you for your patience and for reading till this point! 

Have a nice day!
