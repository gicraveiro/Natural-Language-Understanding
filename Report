Assignment 2 Report

Coming soon!

Unfortunately, I have a busy schedule between classes, internship and decent health-care habits so I could not dedicate enough time to finish this project yet, and thus, write its report...

On that note,
a simple evaluation was successfully implemented for the first part, total and per token
However, the conlleval evaluation still outputs a strange error, despite its parameters (references and hypothesis), who seem fine

The entity grouping was also majorly implemented but the entities that don't belong to noun chunks are not present yet
There is also still an issue with the frequency analysis part, my guess is that I spent so many neurons this afternoon that they can no longer help me finish this relatively simple frequency count in time

The last part, to be honest I haven't even fully understood yet what the task is, so I didn't even try to implement it yet, but I'll get to it at some point

I apologize in advance, but let's hope everything gets implemented soon!

If I still dedicate my free time to this project, I guess I can finish it in a week, but since it's past the deadline maybe I will priorize other activities instead :)
(unless there's some mercy involved of course)

It really has been a pleasure to code nlp-related assignments and I do hope it's understandable that my mental health is just as important as my career, as well as my internship and other classes are just as important as this one

In any case, Thank you for your patience and for reading till this point! 

Have a nice day!
